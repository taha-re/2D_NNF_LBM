## 📖 About

This repository contains a Fortran code implementing a Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) solver, developed during my PhD research. The solver is designed for complex multi-physics simulations, including:

*   **Fluid-Solid Interaction (FSI):** Simulating the motion of rigid and deformable particles in Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids.
*   **Non-Newtonian Fluids:** Modeling viscoplastic (Bingham-type) fluids with yield stress.
*   **Porous Media:** Simulating the dynamics of porous particles within a fluid domain.

The code has been rigorously validated against established benchmarks and finite element method (FEM) results, demonstrating excellent accuracy and robustness. It has been used as the core simulation engine for several peer-reviewed publications.

## 🧪 Validation Cases

The solver's capabilities have been verified through the following benchmark problems. Each case has a dedicated folder containing the Fortran source code and necessary input files to reproduce the results.

### 1. Free Fall of a Rigid Circular Particle in a Newtonian Fluid
*   **Folder:** `1_FreeFall_Circular`
*   **Description:** A rigid circular particle is released from rest in a closed 2D channel filled with a Newtonian fluid and settles under gravity. The simulation captures the particle's trajectory, velocity, translational kinetic energy, and Reynolds number until it impacts the bottom wall.
*   **Validation:** Results for vertical position, velocity, and kinetic energy show excellent agreement with Finite Element Method (FEM) results from **Wan & Turek**.
*   **Key Highlight:** The present LBM algorithm correctly predicts a zero final velocity upon impact, accurately modeling the particle as rigid, unlike some FEM approaches that show residual velocity due to mesh deformation.

### 2. Interaction of Two Settling Particles in a Newtonian Fluid
*   **Folder:** `2_DKT_Newtonian`
*   **Description:** This case tests the implemented force scheme by simulating the interaction and drafting-kissing-tumbling (DKT) dynamics of two settling circular particles in a Newtonian fluid.
*   **Validation:** The time histories of vertical/horizontal position and velocity for both particles match well with the FEM results of **Wan & Turek**.
*   **Key Highlight:** The LBM solver successfully captures the complex interaction where the trailing particle (P1) catches up and collides with the leading particle (P2) due to reduced drag in its wake.

### 3. Sedimentation of Multiple Particles in a 2D Closed Cavity
*   **Folder:** `3_MultiParticle_Sedimentation`
*   **Description:** This case evaluates the solver's ability to handle a large number of particles. 504 circular particles are released from rest in a closed 2D cavity.
*   **Validation:** The overall sedimentation process and the formation of two vortices near the side walls are consistent with the finite difference results of **Glowinski et al.**.
*   **Key Highlight:** The solver efficiently manages multi-body interactions and collision dynamics in a dense system.

### 4. Oscillating Circular Particle in a Stationary Fluid
*   **Folder:** `4_Oscillating_Particle`
*   **Description:** A circular particle oscillates horizontally with a prescribed velocity in a stationary Newtonian fluid at a high Reynolds number (Re=100) and Keulegan-Carpenter number (KC=5).
*   **Validation:** The computed drag coefficient history and velocity profiles in the domain show excellent agreement with numerical and experimental data from **Dütsch et al. [75]**.
*   **Key Highlight:** This case underscores the critical importance of including the **internal mass (or added mass)** effect in the momentum exchange calculation for unsteady flows. Neglecting it leads to significant errors in the predicted force on the body.

### 5. Drag on a Particle in Creeping Flow of a Yield-Stress Fluid
*   **Folder:** `5_YieldStress_Drag`
*   **Description:** The drag force on a stationary circular particle in a creeping flow of a Bingham-Papanastasiou fluid is computed for a wide range of Bingham numbers (Bn) and channel confinement ratios (H/D).
*   **Validation:** The computed drag coefficients show remarkable agreement with Finite Element Method results from **Mitsoulis**.
*   **Key Highlight:** The solver reliably computes forces in yield-stress fluids. Results show that drag becomes independent of channel confinement for Bn ≥ 10 and increases sharply with Bn.

### 6. Free Fall of a Rigid Particle in a Yield-Stress Fluid
*   **Folder:** `6_FreeFall_YieldStress`
*   **Description:** A rigid circular particle settles under gravity in a 2D channel filled with a Bingham fluid. The terminal velocity and settling behavior are investigated for different yield numbers (Y).
*   **Validation:** The time history of the settling velocity for a specific yield number (Y=0.033) agrees well with the results of **Wachs & Frigaard**, who used an Augmented Lagrangian (AL) with Distributed Lagrange Multiplier/Fictitious Domain (DLM/FD) method.
*   **Key Highlight:** Confirms the solver's capability to handle fully coupled fluid-particle dynamics in complex non-Newtonian fluids.

### 7. Settling of an Impermeable Elliptic Porous Particle in a Newtonian Fluid
*   **Folder:** `7_Porous_Elliptic`
*   **Description:** The trajectory of an impermeable elliptic particle settling in a narrow channel is simulated, with initial conditions both on and off the channel centerline.
*   **Validation:** The particle's settling path in both wide (β=4) and narrow (β=16/13) channels is in excellent agreement with the results of **Xia et al. [78]** and **Zhou et al. [79]**.
*   **Key Highlight:** Validates the porous media module. The particle is modeled as effectively impermeable by using very low porosity (ε=0.1) and Darcy number (Da=10⁻⁶).

### 8. Circular Porous Particle in a Fluid between Two Moving Plates
*   **Folder:** `8_Porous_ShearFlow`
*   **Description:** A stationary circular porous particle is placed in a channel where the top and bottom walls move with a constant velocity, creating a shear flow.
*   **Validation:** The velocity profiles along two cross-sections (A-A and B-B) through the domain show perfect agreement with the numerical results of **Pepona & Favier [80]**.
*   **Key Highlight:** Further confirms the accuracy of the porous media solver for different flow configurations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Navigate** to the folder of the validation case you are interested in.
2.  **Compile** the Fortran source file using a standard Fortran compiler (e.g., `gfortran`).
    ```bash
    gfortran -O3 -o lbm_solver main.f90
    ```
3.  **Run** the executable.
    ```bash
    ./lbm_solver
    ```
4.  The code will generate output files (which should be post-processesed by python or Tecplot) in the folder.
